### Heavy Vaginal Bleeding
Any bleeding heavier than a period, with or without pain. Can signal placenta praevia, placental abruption, or miscarriage.

### Severe Abdominal Pain
Constant, severe pain that does not ease. Different from normal stretching or Braxton Hicks.

### Severe Headache
A sudden, very severe headache — especially with visual disturbances — can be a sign of pre-eclampsia or stroke.

### Swelling of Face or Hands
Some ankle swelling is normal late in pregnancy. But sudden swelling of the face or hands, especially with headache or blurred vision, is a danger sign of pre-eclampsia.

### Blurred Vision or Seeing Spots
A symptom of dangerously high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia/eclampsia). Call for help immediately.

### Convulsions or Fits
Seizures in pregnancy (eclampsia) are a life-threatening emergency. Lay the woman on her left side and get to hospital immediately.

### Fever With or Without Chills
High fever can indicate severe malaria, urinary tract infection, or other serious infections that can cause preterm labour.

### Difficulty Breathing or Chest Pain
Can indicate severe anaemia, pulmonary embolism, or heart problems.

### Baby Has Stopped Moving
From 28 weeks, if you count fewer than 10 movements in 2 hours after a meal, go to hospital. Do not wait until the next day.

### Leaking Fluid From the Vagina Before 37 Weeks
May indicate premature rupture of membranes — risk of cord prolapse and infection.

## What to Do

1. **Do not wait** — these signs can worsen rapidly.
2. Go to the nearest hospital with maternity services.
3. Bring your **ANC card**.
4. If you cannot get to hospital, call **112** (Nigeria national emergency line).`,

### Heavy Bleeding (Postpartum Haemorrhage)
Soaking more than one pad per hour, passing large clots, or feeling faint. **Most maternal deaths in Nigeria occur from postpartum haemorrhage.** Go to hospital immediately.

### High Fever (Above 38°C / 100.4°F)
In the first week after birth, fever often indicates uterine infection (endometritis) or wound infection. Do not ignore it.

### Foul-Smelling Vaginal Discharge
Normal lochia (postnatal bleeding) is red for a few days then becomes pink and then yellowish-white. If it smells foul, infection is likely.

### Swollen, Red, or Painful Legs
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — a blood clot — can occur after delivery. One leg more swollen or painful than the other is a warning sign.

### Difficulty Urinating or Burning When Urinating
Urinary tract infections are common after birth. Treat promptly — untreated UTIs can reach the kidneys.

### Signs of Pre-eclampsia Continuing After Birth
Headache, blurred vision, or high blood pressure can persist up to 6 weeks postpartum. Attend your postnatal visits.
