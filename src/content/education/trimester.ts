        content: `## What Is Happening

Your baby grows from a single cell to the size of a lime. The heart begins beating around week 6. Major organs — brain, spine, heart, and limbs — form during this period, making it the most critical time for fetal development.

## Common Symptoms

- **Nausea and vomiting** — most common in the morning but can happen any time. Eat small, frequent meals. Ginger tea or plain crackers may help.
- **Fatigue** — your body is working hard. Rest when you can.
- **Breast tenderness** — normal due to hormonal changes.
- **Frequent urination** — your kidneys are working harder.
- **Mood changes** — hormones affect emotions. This is normal.

## What to Start Taking Immediately

- **Folic acid** — 400 mcg daily, reduces risk of neural tube defects. Start before pregnancy if possible.
- **Iron supplements** — as prescribed at your first ANC visit.
- **Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and unprescribed drugs** — these cause serious harm to the baby.

## Your First ANC Visit

Book your first antenatal care (ANC) visit **before 12 weeks**. At this visit, the provider will:
- Confirm your pregnancy and estimate your due date
- Check your blood pressure, weight, and urine
- Screen for anaemia, HIV, syphilis, and malaria
- Give you your ANC card — **keep it safe and bring it to every visit**

## When to Seek Help Immediately

Go to hospital if you experience heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or high fever.`,

        summary:
          'Many women feel better in the second trimester. You will start to feel your baby move and have an important anatomy scan.',
        content: `## What Is Happening

The second trimester is often called the "golden period" — nausea usually eases, energy returns, and your bump becomes visible. Your baby can now hear sounds, and all major organs are formed and growing.

## Feeling Your Baby Move

Most women feel the first movements (**quickening**) between weeks 18 and 22. First-time mothers may notice it later. Movements feel like butterflies, bubbles, or gentle taps. If you are past 22 weeks and have not felt movement, tell your ANC provider.

## The 18–20 Week Anatomy Scan

This ultrasound checks:
- Baby's growth and position
- Heart structure and major organs
- Placenta location
- Amniotic fluid level

**Attend this scan even if you feel well** — it can detect problems that have no symptoms.

## Common Changes

- Backache — wear flat shoes, avoid heavy lifting, sleep on your left side with a pillow between your knees.
- Leg cramps — stretch your calf muscles and stay hydrated.
- Heartburn — eat small meals, avoid lying down immediately after eating.
- Skin changes — darkening of the skin (linea nigra, melasma) are normal and fade after birth.

## ANC Visits This Trimester

Attend ANC at **20 weeks and 26 weeks**. At these visits your provider will measure fundal height to check the baby is growing well and check for anaemia.`,

        summary:
          'The final stretch. Learn to count kicks, recognise true labour, and prepare your birth plan.',
        content: `## What Is Happening

Your baby gains most of its weight in these weeks and moves into a head-down position ready for birth. You may feel Braxton Hicks contractions (practice contractions) — these are irregular and go away when you change position.

## Kick Counting

From 28 weeks, count fetal movements every day:
- After a meal, lie on your left side
- Count how long it takes to feel **10 movements**
- If it takes more than 2 hours, or movements suddenly decrease, **go to hospital immediately**

## True Labour vs Braxton Hicks

| True Labour | Braxton Hicks |
|---|---|
| Contractions become regular and closer together | Irregular, no pattern |
| Pain increases over time | Stays the same or eases |
| Does not stop with rest or movement | Often stops when you change position |
| Bloody show or waters may break | No fluid |

## When to Go to Hospital

Go **immediately** if:
- Contractions are 5 minutes apart, lasting 60 seconds, for 1 hour
- Your waters break
- Heavy vaginal bleeding
- Baby stops moving
- Severe headache or blurred vision
- Difficulty breathing

## ANC Visits This Trimester

Attend at **30, 34, 36, 38, and 40 weeks**. Do not miss these — your provider monitors blood pressure closely as pre-eclampsia risk rises in late pregnancy.`,
